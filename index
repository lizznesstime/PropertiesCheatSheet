        <h2>What is a Property?</h2>
        <p>In CSS, properties are used to assign a characteristic or behavoir to a targetted HTML element.</p>
            <h2>How Do We Use Properites?:</h2>
            <p>We can target a specific element by creating a ruleset in a css document that is linked to our HTML file.<br>
                Inside this ruleset, we can list any number of properties (there are more than 200!) to style the element in question.<br>
                As with most things, an example here might help:<br>

                <span class="example"> p {<br>
                    color: orange;<br>
                    font-family: Arial;<br>
                }</span><br>

                The above rule-set uses the <a class="property">color</a>and <a class="property">font-family</a> properties to style all paragraph elements to appear in orange Arial font.
